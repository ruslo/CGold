CGold: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the CMake
------------------------------------------

.. warning::

  **THIS DOCUMENT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION! WORK IN PROGRESS!**

Welcome to **CGold**!

This guide will show you how to use :ref:`CMake <CMake>` and will help you to
write elegant, correct and scalable projects. We'll start from the simple cases
and add more features one by one. This tutorial covers only part of the CMake
capabilities - some topics are skipped intentionally in favor of better modern
approaches [1]_. Document designed to be a good tutorial for the very beginners
but touches some aspects in which advanced developers may be interested too.
Look at this document as a skeleton/starting point for further CMake learning.

Enjoy!
