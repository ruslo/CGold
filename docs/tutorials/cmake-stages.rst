CMake stages
------------

We start with a theory. Let's introduce some terminology about
:ref:`CMake <CMake>` commands we have executed :doc:`before </first-step>`.

.. _configure:

Configure step
==============

On this step CMake will parse top level :ref:`CMakeLists.txt <cmakelists.txt>`
of :ref:`source tree <source tree>` and create
:ref:`CMakeCache.txt <cmakecache.txt>` file with
:ref:`cache variables <cache variables>`. Different types of variables will be
described further in details. For CMake-GUI this step triggered by clicking
on ``Configure`` button. For CMake command-line this step is combined with
generate step so terms configure and generate will be used interchangeably.
The end of this step expressed by ``Configuring done`` message from CMake.

.. terminology discussion:
.. * http://www.mail-archive.com/cmake%40cmake.org/msg55116.html

GUI + Xcode example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's add `message <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/message.html>`__
command to the example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/minimal-with-message/CMakeLists.txt
  :language: cmake
  :emphasize-lines: 8

.. admonition:: Examples on GitHub

  * `Repository <https://github.com/cgold-examples/minimal-with-message>`__
  * `Latest ZIP <https://github.com/cgold-examples/minimal-with-message/archive/master.zip>`__

Line ``Processing CMakeLists.txt`` will be printed by CMake while parsing
CMakeLists.txt file, i.e. on configure step. Open CMake-GUI, setup directories
and hit ``Configure``:

.. image:: cmake-stages/xcode-screens/01-configure.png
  :align: center

You can verify that there is no Xcode project generated by now but only
CMakeCache.txt with cache variables:

.. code-block:: none

  [minimal-with-message-master]> ls _builds
  CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/

Let's run configure one more time:

.. image:: cmake-stages/xcode-screens/02-configure-again.png
  :align: center

We still see ``Process CMakeLists.txt`` message which means that CMakeLists.txt
was parsed again but there is no check/detect messages. This is because
information about compiler and different tools detection results saved
in CMake internal directories and reused. You may notice that second run
happens much faster than first.

No surprises, there is still no Xcode project:

.. code-block:: none

  [minimal-with-message-master]> ls _builds
  CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/

.. _generate:

Generate step
=============

On this step CMake will generate :ref:`native build tool <native build tool>`
files using information from CMakeLists.txt and variables from CMakeCache.txt.
For CMake-GUI this step triggered by clicking on ``Generate`` button.
For CMake command-line this step is combined with configure step.
The end of this step expressed by ``Generating done`` message from CMake.

GUI + Xcode example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hit ``Generate`` now:

.. image:: cmake-stages/xcode-screens/03-generate.png
  :align: center

Now Xcode project created:

.. code-block:: none

  [minimal-with-message-master]> ls -d _builds/foo.xcodeproj
  _builds/foo.xcodeproj/

Makefile example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example of generating Makefile on Linux:

.. code-block:: none

  [minimal-with-message-master]> rm -rf _builds
  [minimal-with-message-master]> cmake -H. -B_builds

  -- The C compiler identification is GNU 4.8.4
  -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 4.8.4
  -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc
  -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc -- works
  -- Detecting C compiler ABI info
  -- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done
  -- Detecting C compile features
  -- Detecting C compile features - done
  -- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++
  -- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++ -- works
  -- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info
  -- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done
  -- Detecting CXX compile features
  -- Detecting CXX compile features - done
  Processing CMakeLists.txt
  -- Configuring done
  -- Generating done
  -- Build files have been written to: /.../minimal-with-message-master/_builds

We see ``Processing CMakeLists.txt``, ``Configuring done`` and
``Generating done`` messages meaning that CMakeLists.txt was parsed and
both configure/generate steps combined into one action.

Verify Makefile generated:

.. code-block:: none

  [minimal-with-message-master]> ls _builds/Makefile
  _builds/Makefile

If you run configure again CMakeLists.txt will be parsed one more time and
``Processing CMakeLists.txt`` will be in output:

.. code-block:: none

  [minimal-with-message-master]> cmake -H. -B_builds
  Processing CMakeLists.txt
  -- Configuring done
  -- Generating done
  -- Build files have been written to: /.../minimal-with-message-master/_builds

.. _build:

Build step
==========

This step is orchestrated by native build tool. On this step targets of your
project will be build.

Xcode example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run native tool build:

.. code-block:: none

  [minimal-with-message-master]> cmake --build _builds

  === BUILD AGGREGATE TARGET ZERO_CHECK OF PROJECT foo WITH CONFIGURATION Debug ===

  Check dependencies

  ...

  === BUILD TARGET foo OF PROJECT foo WITH CONFIGURATION Debug ===

  ...

      /.../Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang -x c++ ...
          -c /.../minimal-with-message-master/foo.cpp
          -o /.../minimal-with-message-master/_builds/foo.build/Debug/foo.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/foo.o

  ...

      /.../Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang++ ...
          -o /Users/ruslo/minimal-with-message-master/_builds/Debug/foo

  === BUILD AGGREGATE TARGET ALL_BUILD OF PROJECT foo WITH CONFIGURATION Debug ===

  ...

  Build all projects

  ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **

You can see that ``foo.cpp`` compiled into ``foo.o`` and then executable ``foo``
created. There is no ``Processing CMakeLists.txt`` message in output because on
this stage CMake doesn't parse CMakeLists.txt however re-configure may be
triggered on build step automatically, this will be shown in
:doc:`workflow <workflow>` section.

Makefile example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run native tool build:

.. code-block:: none

  [minimal-with-message-master]> cmake --build _builds
  Scanning dependencies of target foo
  [ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/foo.dir/foo.cpp.o
  [100%] Linking CXX executable foo
  [100%] Built target foo

You can see that ``foo.cpp`` compiled into ``foo.cpp.o`` and then executable ``foo``
created. There is no ``Processing CMakeLists.txt`` message in output because on
this stage CMake doesn't parse CMakeLists.txt however re-configure may be
triggered on build step automatically, this will be shown in
:doc:`workflow <workflow>` section.
