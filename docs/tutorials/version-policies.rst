Version and policies
--------------------

Like any other piece of software :ref:`CMake <CMake>` evolves, effectively
introducing new features and deprecating dangerous or confusing behavior.

There are two entities that help you to manage difference between old and new
versions of CMake:

* Command
  `cmake_minimum_required <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_minimum_required.html>`__:
  for checking what minimum version of CMake user should have to run your
  configuration

* `CMake policies <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-policies.7.html>`__:
  for fine tuning newly introduced behavior

If you just want to experiment without worrying about backward compatibility,
policies, warnings, etc. just set **first line** of CMakeLists.txt to
``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION a.b.c)`` where ``a.b.c`` is a current version
of CMake you're using:

.. code-block:: none

  > cmake --version
  cmake version 3.5.2

  > cat CMakeLists.txt
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5.2)

cmake_minimum_required
======================

.. admonition:: CMake documentation

 * `cmake_minimum_required <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_minimum_required.html>`__

What version to put into this command is mostly an executive decision. You
need to know:

* what version is installed on users hosts?
* is it appropriate to ask them to install newer version?
* what features do they need?
* do you need to be backward compatible for one users and have fresh features
  for another?

The last case will fit most of them but will harder to maintain for developer
and probably will require automatic testing system with good coverage.

For example the code with version ``2.8`` as a minimum one and with ``3.0``
features will look like:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)

  if(NOT CMAKE_VERSION VERSION_LESS "3.0") # means 'NOT version < 3.0', i.e. 'version >= 3.0'
    # Code with 3.0 features
  endif()

Command ``cmake_minimum_required`` **must be the first** command in your
:ref:`CMakeLists.txt <cmakelists.txt>`. If you're planning to support several
versions of CMake then you need to put the smallest one in
``cmake_minimum_required`` and call it in the first line of CMakeLists.txt.

.. _cmake_minimum_required should be first:

Even if some commands look harmless, they might not be. For example, ``project``
is the place where a lot of checks happens and where the
toolchain is loaded. If you run this example on ``Cygwin`` platform:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/minimum-required-example/bad/CMakeLists.txt
  :language: cmake

CMake will think that you're running code with old policies and warns you:

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 4-5

  [minimum-required-example]> cmake -Hbad -B_builds/bad
  -- The C compiler identification is GNU 4.9.3
  -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 4.9.3
  CMake Warning at /.../share/cmake-3.3.1/Modules/Platform/CYGWIN.cmake:15 (message):
    CMake no longer defines WIN32 on Cygwin!

    (1) If you are just trying to build this project, ignore this warning or
    quiet it by setting CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32=0 in your environment or in
    the CMake cache.  If later configuration or build errors occur then this
    project may have been written under the assumption that Cygwin is WIN32.
    In that case, set CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32=1 instead.

    (2) If you are developing this project, add the line

      set(CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32 0) # Remove when CMake >= 2.8.4 is required

    at the top of your top-level CMakeLists.txt file or set the minimum
    required version of CMake to 2.8.4 or higher.  Then teach your project to
    build on Cygwin without WIN32.

CMake policies
==============

.. admonition:: CMake documentation

 * `CMake policies <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-policies.7.html>`__

When a new version of CMake is released, there may be a list of policies describing
cases when behavior changed comparing to the previous CMake version.

Let's see how it works in practice. In CMake ``3.0`` policy
`CMP0038 <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0038.html>`__
was introduced. Before version ``3.0``, a target could be linked to itself,
which make no sense and definitely **is a bug**:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/policy-examples/bug-2.8/CMakeLists.txt
  :language: cmake
  :emphasize-lines: 6

.. admonition:: Examples on GitHub

  * `Repository <https://github.com/cgold-examples/policy-examples>`__
  * `Latest ZIP <https://github.com/cgold-examples/policy-examples/archive/master.zip>`__

Works fine for CMake before ``3.0``:

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 2,4

  [policy-examples]> cmake --version
  cmake version 2.8.12.2
  [policy-examples]> rm -rf _builds
  [policy-examples]> cmake -Hbug-2.8 -B_builds

  -- Build files have been written to: /.../policy-examples/_builds

For CMake version ``>= 3.0`` warning will be reported:

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 2,4,7

  [policy-examples]> cmake --version
  cmake version 3.5.2
  [policy-examples]> rm -rf _builds
  [policy-examples]> cmake -Hbug-2.8 -B_builds
  ...
  -- Configuring done
  CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:4 (add_library):

    command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

Assume you want to drop support for the old version and more to some new
``3.0`` features. When you set ``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)``

.. literalinclude:: /examples/policy-examples/set-3.0/CMakeLists.txt
  :diff: /examples/policy-examples/bug-2.8/CMakeLists.txt

warning turns into error:

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 2,18

  [policy-examples]> rm -rf _builds
  [policy-examples]> cmake -Hset-3.0 -B_builds

Two cases will be shown below. In the first case we want to keep support of
version ``2.8`` so it will work with both ``CMake 2.8`` and
``CMake 3.0+``. In the second case we decide to drop support of version ``2.8`` and move
to ``CMake 3.0+``. We'll see how it affects the policies. It will be shown
that without **using new features** from ``CMake 3.0``, it
doesn't make sense to change ``cmake_minimum_required``.

Keep using old
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our project works fine with ``CMake 2.8`` however ``CMake 3.0+`` emits
warning. We don't want to fix the error now but want only to suppress warning
and explain to CMake that it should behaves like ``CMake 2.8``.

.. note::

  This approach described in
  `documentation <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-policies.7.html#introduction>`__:

  .. code-block:: none

    It is possible to disable the warning by explicitly requesting the OLD, or
    backward compatible behavior using the cmake_policy() command

Let's add
`cmake_policy <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_policy.html>`__:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/policy-examples/unknown-2.8/CMakeLists.txt
  :language: cmake
  :emphasize-lines: 4

Looks good for ``CMake 3.0+``:

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 2,4

  [policy-examples]> cmake --version
  cmake version 3.5.2
  [policy-examples]> rm -rf _builds
  [policy-examples]> cmake -Hunknown-2.8 -B_builds
  -- The C compiler identification is GNU 4.8.4
  -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 4.8.4
  -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc
  -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc -- works
  -- Detecting C compiler ABI info
  -- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done
  -- Detecting C compile features
  -- Detecting C compile features - done
  -- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++

  -- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info

  -- Detecting CXX compile features
  -- Detecting CXX compile features - done
  -- Configuring done
  -- Generating done

Are we done? No, ``CMP0038`` is introduced since ``CMake 3.0`` so ``CMake 2.8``
have no idea what this policy is about:

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 2,4,15

  > cmake --version
  cmake version 2.8.12.2
  > rm -rf _builds
  > cmake -Hunknown-2.8 -B_builds

  -- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done
  CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:4 (cmake_policy):
    Policy "CMP0038" is not known to this version of CMake.

  -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

We should protect new code with ``if(POLICY CMP0038)`` condition:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/policy-examples/suppress-2.8/CMakeLists.txt
  :language: cmake
  :emphasize-lines: 4-9

Of course you should find the time, apply real fix and remove policy logic
since it will not be needed anymore:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/policy-examples/fix-2.8/CMakeLists.txt
  :diff: /examples/policy-examples/suppress-2.8/CMakeLists.txt

Final version:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/policy-examples/fix-2.8/CMakeLists.txt
  :language: cmake

Moving to new version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With ``cmake_minimum_required`` updated to ``3.0``, the warning turns into an error.
As a temporary solution, the error can be suppressed by adding a
``cmake_policy`` directive:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/policy-examples/suppress-3.0/CMakeLists.txt
  :language: cmake
  :emphasize-lines: 1,4

.. note::

  We don't need to protect ``cmake_policy`` with ``if(POLICY)``
  condition since ``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)`` guarantee us that
  we are using ``CMake 3.0+``.

This policy can then be removed once a better solution is found:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/policy-examples/fix-3.0/CMakeLists.txt
  :diff: /examples/policy-examples/suppress-3.0/CMakeLists.txt

Final version:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/policy-examples/fix-3.0/CMakeLists.txt
  :language: cmake

You may notice that final version for both cases differs only in ``cmake_minimum_required``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/policy-examples/fix-3.0/CMakeLists.txt
  :diff: /examples/policy-examples/fix-2.8/CMakeLists.txt

It means that there is no much sense in changing ``cmake_minimum_required``
without using any **new features**.

Summary
=======

* Policies can be used to control CMake **behavior**
* Policies can be used to suppress warnings/errors
* ``cmake_minimum_required`` describe **features** you use in CMake code
* For backward compatibility new features can be protected with
  ``if(CMAKE_VERSION ...)`` directive
