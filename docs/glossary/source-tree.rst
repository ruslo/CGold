Source tree
-----------

Hierarchy of directories with source files such as CMake/C++ sources.
:ref:`CMake <CMake>` starts with the :ref:`CMakeLists.txt <CMakeLists.txt>`
from top of the source tree. This directory can be set by :ref:`-S <-S>`
in command line or by ``Browse Source...`` in CMake-GUI.

This directory is mean to be shareable. E.g. probably you should not store
hard-coded paths specific to your local environment in this code. This is
directory that you want to be managed with :ref:`VCS <VCS>`.
